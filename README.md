## Introduction
Nooptime (a terrible pun on Uptime) is an ASP.NET Core uptime monitor that runs in Docker and easy to extend via a simple plugin system.

### Technology

- ASP.NET Core MVC 2.0
- Postgres 9+ (using Marten as a NoSQL datastore)
- Docker for Linux (maybe Windows later)
- Front end technology TBD.

## Developing from the source

The following are required to develop NoopTime:

- Docker for Windows, or Docker for Mac OS X. This is for Postgres
- Some kind of IDE (VS2017 Community Edition is used)
